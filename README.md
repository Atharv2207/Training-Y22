# Simulation Methods

## Random Radial Point Method
If you choose this method, the probability output will be 0.5.

### Steps:
1. Input 1 to select this method.
2. Input the radius of the circle.
3. Input the number of points or simulations you want to perform.

## Random Endpoints Method
If you choose this method, the probability will be 0.33.

### Steps:
1. Input 2 to select this method.
2. Input the radius of the circle.
3. Input the number of points.

## Random Midpoint Method
If you choose this method, the probability will be 0.25.

### Steps:
1. Input 3 to select this method.
2. Input the radius of the circle.
3. Input the number of points.

## Note: The number of simulations should be kept less than 10,000 to avoid unreasonably long runtime.
